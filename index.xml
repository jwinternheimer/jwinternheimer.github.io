      <title>Predicting Churn with General Linear Models: Part 1</title>

      <description>In a text analysis of churn surveys, we found that the most common reason users give for leaving Buffer is that they weren’t using it. The graph below shows the most frequently occuring pairs of words in the surveys – notice “not using” and “don’t need” at the top.
 In this analysis, we’ll identify Business customers that have stopped using Buffer or use it less than they previously had. We’ll create a natural experiment in which users exposed to the experimental and control conditions are determined by their own actions.</description>

      <title>Buffer for Business Feature Audit</title>

      <description>In a previous analysis we discovered that the most common reason users gave for churning was that they weren’t using, or didn’t need, Buffer.
I was inspired by this blog post by Intercom’s Chief Strategy Officer to conduct an audit of the features available to Buffer for Business users in order to see which were being used, and how frequently.
In this post, we will analyze a subset of our features with two simple criteria: how many users use it and how frequently.</description>

      <description>How long do customers stick with Buffer? Are there any covariates that affect the amount of time a user is expected to stay on a paid subscription?
Data collection We can run the following query in Stripe Sigma to gather data on all Stripe subscriptions that have had successful charges.
select subscriptions.id , subscriptions.created , subscriptions.canceled_at , subscriptions.plan_id , plans.interval , subscriptions.customer_id , count(distinct charges.id) as successful_charges from subscriptions left join invoices on invoices.</description>

      <guid>/blog/trial-activity/</guid>
      <description>One question that has come up recently is about Business trialists: how long do they stick with the trial before becoming inactive and churning from Buffer?
To answer this question, we can analyze the data in this Look. The dataset contains the trial start and end dates for each user, as well as the days in which there were any actions_taken events triggered.
The number of actions for each day is counted for up to 30 days after the trial start date for each user.</description>

      <title>Involuntary Churn</title>

      <guid>/blog/involuntary-churn/</guid>
      <description>Involuntary churn is a subset of churn in which the cancellation event was not directly initiated by the customer. For us, this occurs when there have been four consecutive failed payments.
The reasons for the failed payments are varied, but we can assume that there are customers whose intention was to continue subscribing to the service. In most cases, they could not because their credit card either expired or was declined for one reason or another.</description>

      <description>Winter is here. Finally!
I was inspired by this series of blog posts from the Looker team to do my own Game of Thrones inspired data analysis. While Looker’s analysis focuses on the screentime of different characters in the show, I thought it would be interesting to take a different approach and analyze the text corpuses of the George R. R. Martin’s books.
I was particularly inspired by Julia Silge’s analysis of gender roles in Jane Austen’s works, and took a similar approach to exploring the Game of Thrones data.</description>

      <description>Customer support and advocacy play important roles in driving Buffer forward. We don’t just want to provide support to customers in need – we try to use signals and common themes from those conversations to influence decision making on the product team.
The “Pause Queue” button is one recent, small example of how conversations with customers have led to changes in the product.
 To keep these signals organized, we introduced area tags to our support workflow within Helpscout.</description>

      <description>I was inspired by this analysis done by the folks of Looker, which looks at the amount of screentime different characters get in the Game of Thrones series.
The dataset they used comes from data world and an imdb list. I’m grateful to the people that have collected and shared this data.
The dataset includes 191 named characters, the amount of screentime they have (in minutes), and the number of episodes they appear in.</description>

      <description>People decide to leave or stop paying for Buffer every day. It’s unfortunate, but it happens for one reason or another.
We collect a lot of data from these users in the form of surveys. We thought that it might be beneficial to analyze the text of these survey comments to see if we can identify common themes that we could address.
Data collection We’ll use data collected from four separate surveys that represents different types of churn:</description>

      <description>I’ve wanted to build a content recommendation engine for a long time. Buffer is sitting on a mountain of data, which some argue is the most valuable commodity on Earth. We used to provide content suggestions to users through manual curation, but we ended up retiring that feature/service.
In this analysis we’ll build a simple recommendation engine with the recommenderlab R package, using collaborative filtering techniques. To keep it simple, we’ll only look at updates shared by Buffer team members.</description>

      <description>I haven’t asked myself this question before, and I’ve never tried to optimize my Instagram posts for maximum likeage. I have made a couple of observations though:
 Instagram posts that are shared earlier in the day, while my friends and colleagues in Europe are still awake, seem to get more likes more quickly.
 Posts that include people and faces seem to get more likes.
 Images of New York (which happen to include the #nyc hashtag) tend to get lots of likes.</description>

      <description>Introduction Over the past few weeks, simplifying the free plan has become a theme and key component of realizing our product vision. This Paper has a lot of good context and discussion around what that involves.
There are four major components to this change:
 Reducing the profile limit to 2 Reducing the number of updates people can send to 5 per day per profile Removing the ‘Share Now’ option Removing custom scheduling  The goal of this analysis is to estimate how many active users would be affected by each component.</description>

      <description>Introduction A significant part of the Kodiak product cycle and Buffer’s product vision going forward is simplifying the experience for users on a free plan. One of the components we are considering simplifying is the Queue Limit.
As of June 2017, the Queue Limit refers to the number of updates users on a free plan can have in the Queue of a single profile at any single point in time. This can understandable cause some confusion with users, and can also be exploited (e.</description>

      <guid>/blog/share-now/</guid>
      <description>Introduction As part of the next product cycle, we will try to create a simpler, more streamlined experience for Buffer users on a free plan. Part of that simplification process could include the limiting or removal of the option to ‘Share Now’, when drafting updates.
Sharing an update immediately doesn’t add a post to the queue, which could possibly allow for the sending of many updates in a single time period.</description>

 Data collection Let’s start by getting the Free users that have scheduled at least one update in the past 28 days. We’ll use the following SQL query to grab them.</description>

If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?</description>

      <description>To be, or not to be&amp;ndash;that is the question: Whether &amp;lsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep&amp;ndash; No more&amp;ndash;and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. &amp;lsquo;Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep&amp;ndash; To sleep&amp;ndash;perchance to dream: ay, there&amp;rsquo;s the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.</description>

      <description>What is it with that Mary girl? Dragging me to school every day. As if I had a choice. What you don&amp;rsquo;t hear in those nursery rhymes is that she starves me if I don&amp;rsquo;t go to school with her; it&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can stay alive! I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about being adopted by Little Bo Peep, sure I may get lost, but anything is better than being with Mary and those little brats at school (shudder, shudder).</description>

      <description>Piracy is typically an act of robbery or criminal violence at sea. The term can include acts committed on land, in the air, or in other major bodies of water or on a shore. It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). The term has been used throughout history to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents.</description>

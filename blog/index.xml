      <title>How has MRR grown over time?</title>
      <link>/blog/mrr-changepoints/</link>

      <description>In recent times we’ve seen MRR growth that is roughly linear. This wasn’t always the case - Buffer has had periods of higher growth and periods of low growth. We weren’t always growing MRR by 25-30K each month.
In this analysis we’ll try to identify points of inflection at which growth in MRR changed significantly. We’ll use methods in the changepoint package to identify points at which there is a shift in the amount of MRR growth.</description>

      <title>An ad hoc analysis of MRR</title>

      <guid>/blog/mrr-growth-analysis/</guid>
      <description>In this analysis we will look at how MRR has grown in 2017. We will look at the overall growth of MRR as measured by our daily MRR calculation, and we will look at the MRR components (new, churn, etc.) as measured by the Stripe MRR breakdown script.
We will try to determine if there are any long term trends in the MRR we gain and lose each week to determine if net mrr, defined as MRR gained less MRR lost in any given time period, is trending towards 0.</description>

      <title>How much vacation does Buffer take?</title>
      <link>/blog/vacation-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2017 14:56:22 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>Buffer introduced a minimum vacation policy a year ago, in which we encouraged Americans to take at least 15 days of vacation (excluding holidays), Australians to take at least 17 days, Canadians at least 20 days, and Europeans at least 25 days.
In this analysis we’ll try to measure the effect that it has had on the team over the past year. We use timetastic to schedule time off, and we’re lucky enough to have a nice report that shows how much time each team member has taken off.</description>

      <title>Predicting trial conversions with an activation metric</title>
      <link>/blog/trial-activation/</link>

      <description>You’ve likely heard of activation rates before, especially if you’ve worked in a tech company. Facebook famously learned that users that connected with a certain number of friends were significantly more likely to be retained, so they encouraged users to connect with more friends when they signed up.
Causality in that relationship is questionable, but finding a testable hypothesis based on an observed relationship can be a big step forward for companies, especially those with the type of volume that Facebook had.</description>

      <title>Exploring Retention at Buffer</title>
      <link>/blog/retention-exploration/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2017 10:45:16 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>Tech companies are often asked about their retention curves. Growth hacking and marketing techniques can provide new users, but product/market fit and retention loops will keep them using your product.
I realized that I don’t have a solid grasp of Buffer’s retention curve, so I thought I’d make a small post out of the exploration.
Picking the right metrics to use to calculate retention can be a tricky thing. It should be a leading indicator of revenue and repeat behavior.</description>

      <title>Predicting Churn with General Linear Models: Part 1</title>
      <link>/blog/churn-prediction/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 14:02:25 -0400</pubDate>

      <guid>/blog/churn-prediction/</guid>
      <description>In a text analysis of churn surveys, we found that the most common reason users give for leaving Buffer is that they weren’t using it. The graph below shows the most frequently occuring pairs of words in the surveys – notice “not using” and “don’t need” at the top.
 In this analysis, we’ll identify Business customers that have stopped using Buffer or use it less than they previously had. We’ll create a natural experiment in which users exposed to the experimental and control conditions are determined by their own actions.</description>

      <title>Buffer for Business Feature Audit</title>
      <link>/blog/business-feature-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2017 15:18:52 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>In a previous analysis we discovered that the most common reason users gave for churning was that they weren’t using, or didn’t need, Buffer.
I was inspired by this blog post by Intercom’s Chief Strategy Officer to conduct an audit of the features available to Buffer for Business users in order to see which were being used, and how frequently.
In this post, we will analyze a subset of our features with two simple criteria: how many users use it and how frequently.</description>

      <title>When do customers churn?</title>

      <description>How long do customers stick with Buffer? Are there any covariates that affect the amount of time a user is expected to stay on a paid subscription?
Data collection We can run the following query in Stripe Sigma to gather data on all Stripe subscriptions that have had successful charges.
select subscriptions.id , subscriptions.created , subscriptions.canceled_at , subscriptions.plan_id , plans.interval , subscriptions.customer_id , count(distinct charges.id) as successful_charges from subscriptions left join invoices on invoices.</description>

      <title>How active are Business trialists?</title>
      <link>/blog/trial-activity/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2017 14:10:33 -0400</pubDate>
      <author>julianwinternheimer@gmail.com (Julian Winternheimer)</author>
      <guid>/blog/trial-activity/</guid>
      <description>One question that has come up recently is about Business trialists: how long do they stick with the trial before becoming inactive and churning from Buffer?
To answer this question, we can analyze the data in this Look. The dataset contains the trial start and end dates for each user, as well as the days in which there were any actions_taken events triggered.
The number of actions for each day is counted for up to 30 days after the trial start date for each user.</description>

      <title>Involuntary Churn</title>
      <link>/blog/involuntary-churn/</link>

      <author>julianwinternheimer@gmail.com (Julian Winternheimer)</author>
      <guid>/blog/involuntary-churn/</guid>
      <description>Involuntary churn is a subset of churn in which the cancellation event was not directly initiated by the customer. For us, this occurs when there have been four consecutive failed payments.
The reasons for the failed payments are varied, but we can assume that there are customers whose intention was to continue subscribing to the service. In most cases, they could not because their credit card either expired or was declined for one reason or another.</description>

      <title>Game of Thrones Book Analysis</title>

      <description>Winter is here. Finally!
I was inspired by this series of blog posts from the Looker team to do my own Game of Thrones inspired data analysis. While Looker’s analysis focuses on the screentime of different characters in the show, I thought it would be interesting to take a different approach and analyze the text corpuses of the George R. R. Martin’s books.
I was particularly inspired by Julia Silge’s analysis of gender roles in Jane Austen’s works, and took a similar approach to exploring the Game of Thrones data.</description>

      <description>Customer support and advocacy play important roles in driving Buffer forward. We don’t just want to provide support to customers in need – we try to use signals and common themes from those conversations to influence decision making on the product team.
The “Pause Queue” button is one recent, small example of how conversations with customers have led to changes in the product.
 To keep these signals organized, we introduced area tags to our support workflow within Helpscout.</description>

      <description>I was inspired by this analysis done by the folks of Looker, which looks at the amount of screentime different characters get in the Game of Thrones series.
The dataset they used comes from data world and an imdb list. I’m grateful to the people that have collected and shared this data.
The dataset includes 191 named characters, the amount of screentime they have (in minutes), and the number of episodes they appear in.</description>

      <title>Why Users Churn: A Text Analysis of Churn Surveys</title>

      <description>People decide to leave or stop paying for Buffer every day. It’s unfortunate, but it happens for one reason or another.
We collect a lot of data from these users in the form of surveys. We thought that it might be beneficial to analyze the text of these survey comments to see if we can identify common themes that we could address.
Data collection We’ll use data collected from four separate surveys that represents different types of churn:</description>

      <title>Simple Content Recommendations in R</title>

      <description>I’ve wanted to build a content recommendation engine for a long time. Buffer is sitting on a mountain of data, which some argue is the most valuable commodity on Earth. We used to provide content suggestions to users through manual curation, but we ended up retiring that feature/service.
In this analysis we’ll build a simple recommendation engine with the recommenderlab R package, using collaborative filtering techniques. To keep it simple, we’ll only look at updates shared by Buffer team members.</description>

      <title>How do I get more likes on Instagram?</title>

      <description>I haven’t asked myself this question before, and I’ve never tried to optimize my Instagram posts for maximum likeage. I have made a couple of observations though:
 Instagram posts that are shared earlier in the day, while my friends and colleagues in Europe are still awake, seem to get more likes more quickly.
 Posts that include people and faces seem to get more likes.
 Images of New York (which happen to include the #nyc hashtag) tend to get lots of likes.</description>

      <description>Introduction Over the past few weeks, simplifying the free plan has become a theme and key component of realizing our product vision. This Paper has a lot of good context and discussion around what that involves.
There are four major components to this change:
 Reducing the profile limit to 2 Reducing the number of updates people can send to 5 per day per profile Removing the ‘Share Now’ option Removing custom scheduling  The goal of this analysis is to estimate how many active users would be affected by each component.</description>

      <description>Introduction A significant part of the Kodiak product cycle and Buffer’s product vision going forward is simplifying the experience for users on a free plan. One of the components we are considering simplifying is the Queue Limit.
As of June 2017, the Queue Limit refers to the number of updates users on a free plan can have in the Queue of a single profile at any single point in time. This can understandable cause some confusion with users, and can also be exploited (e.</description>

      <guid>/blog/share-now/</guid>
      <description>Introduction As part of the next product cycle, we will try to create a simpler, more streamlined experience for Buffer users on a free plan. Part of that simplification process could include the limiting or removal of the option to ‘Share Now’, when drafting updates.
Sharing an update immediately doesn’t add a post to the queue, which could possibly allow for the sending of many updates in a single time period.</description>

 Data collection Let’s start by getting the Free users that have scheduled at least one update in the past 28 days. We’ll use the following SQL query to grab them.</description>

The purpose of this analysis is to get a better understanding of how users currently interact with the free plan, in order to better inform decisions around future plan limits.

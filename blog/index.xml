      <title>How active are Business trialists?</title>

      <description>One question that has come up recently is about Business trialists: how long do they stick with the trial before becoming inactive and churning from Buffer?
To answer this question, we can analyze the data in this Look. The dataset contains the trial start and end dates for each user, as well as the days in which there were any actions_taken events triggered.
The number of actions for each day is counted for up to 30 days after the trial start date for each user.</description>

      <title>Involuntary Churn</title>

      <description>Involuntary churn is a subset of churn in which the cancellation event was not directly initiated by the customer. For us, this occurs when there have been four consecutive failed payments.
The reasons for the failed payments are varied, but we can assume that there are customers whose intention was to continue subscribing to the service. In most cases, they could not because their credit card either expired or was declined for one reason or another.</description>

      <title>Game of Thrones Book Analysis</title>

      <description>Winter is here. Finally!
I was inspired by this series of blog posts from the Looker team to do my own Game of Thrones inspired data analysis. While Looker’s analysis focuses on the screentime of different characters in the show, I thought it would be interesting to take a different approach and analyze the text corpuses of the George R. R. Martin’s books.
I was particularly inspired by Julia Silge’s analysis of gender roles in Jane Austen’s works, and took a similar approach to exploring the Game of Thrones data.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Product with Support Tickets</title>

      <description>Customer support and advocacy play important roles in driving Buffer forward. We don’t just want to provide support to customers in need – we try to use signals and common themes from those conversations to influence decision making on the product team.
The “Pause Queue” button is one recent, small example of how conversations with customers have led to changes in the product.
 To keep these signals organized, we introduced area tags to our support workflow within Helpscout.</description>

      <description>I was inspired by this analysis done by the folks of Looker, which looks at the amount of screentime different characters get in the Game of Thrones series.
The dataset they used comes from data world and an imdb list. I’m grateful to the people that have collected and shared this data.
The dataset includes 191 named characters, the amount of screentime they have (in minutes), and the number of episodes they appear in.</description>

      <title>Simple Content Recommendations in R</title>

      <description>I’ve wanted to build a content recommendation engine for a long time. Buffer is sitting on a mountain of data, which some argue is the most valuable commodity on Earth. We used to provide content suggestions to users through manual curation, but we ended up retiring that feature/service.
In this analysis we’ll build a simple recommendation engine with the recommenderlab R package, using collaborative filtering techniques. To keep it simple, we’ll only look at updates shared by Buffer team members.</description>

      <title>Why Users Churn</title>

      <description>People decide to leave or stop paying for Buffer. It’s unfortunate, but it happens for one reason or another.
We collect a lot of data from these users in the form of churn surveys. It might be beneficial to analyze the text of these survey comments to see if we can learn anything new.
Data collection The data we’ll use in this analysis comes from this look and will be imported with the get_look() function from the buffer package.</description>

      <title>How do I get more likes on Instagram?</title>

      <description>I haven’t asked myself this question before, and I’ve never tried to optimize my Instagram posts for maximum likeage. I have made a couple of observations though:
 Instagram posts that are shared earlier in the day, while my friends and colleagues in Europe are still awake, seem to get more likes more quickly.
 Posts that include people and faces seem to get more likes.
 Images of New York (which happen to include the #nyc hashtag) tend to get lots of likes.</description>

      <title>How many users will be affected by the Free plan limits?</title>

      <description>Introduction Over the past few weeks, simplifying the free plan has become a theme and key component of realizing our product vision. This Paper has a lot of good context and discussion around what that involves.
There are four major components to this change:
 Reducing the profile limit to 2 Reducing the number of updates people can send to 5 per day per profile Removing the ‘Share Now’ option Removing custom scheduling  The goal of this analysis is to estimate how many active users would be affected by each component.</description>

      <description>Introduction A significant part of the Kodiak product cycle and Buffer’s product vision going forward is simplifying the experience for users on a free plan. One of the components we are considering simplifying is the Queue Limit.
As of June 2017, the Queue Limit refers to the number of updates users on a free plan can have in the Queue of a single profile at any single point in time. This can understandable cause some confusion with users, and can also be exploited (e.</description>

      <guid>/blog/share-now/</guid>
      <description>Introduction As part of the next product cycle, we will try to create a simpler, more streamlined experience for Buffer users on a free plan. Part of that simplification process could include the limiting or removal of the option to ‘Share Now’, when drafting updates.
Sharing an update immediately doesn’t add a post to the queue, which could possibly allow for the sending of many updates in a single time period.</description>

      <description>Introduction The goal of this analysis is to better understand how users use the Free plan, in order to better inform our decisions around changing its limits. In this analysis specifically, we’ll look at the number of updates that active users share on a daily basis.
 Data collection Let’s start by getting the Free users that have scheduled at least one update in the past 28 days. We’ll use the following SQL query to grab them.</description>

      <description>Introduction There is a big focus on simplifying the product for Buffer users on free plans in 2017 in order to create a more intuitive experience and encourage more upgrades.
The purpose of this analysis is to get a better understanding of how users currently interact with the free plan, in order to better inform decisions around future plan limits. Specifically, we would love to learn about how many profiles users connect and actually schedule updates for.</description>
